### **Permission System**
- **Feature-level**: Each feature checks user permissions
- **Data Access**: Role-based data filtering
- **Action-based**: Role-specific actions and capabilities

## 🧪 Testing the Flow

### **Test URLs**
- `/test-roles` - Basic role testing component
- `/test-flow` - Comprehensive flow testing component
- `/dashboard` - Auto-redirect to role-appropriate dashboard

### **Testing Steps**
1. **Login** with different user roles
2. **Access** `/dashboard` to test auto-redirect
3. **Navigate** through role-specific features
4. **Verify** access restrictions work correctly
5. **Test** unauthorized access attempts
